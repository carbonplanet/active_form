# Active Form

This is an updated version of the original `active_form`
with modifications such that it runs under Ruby 1.9 or better.

The problem was that Ruby 1.8 had a thing called `ParseDate` which is no
longer present in Ruby 1.9.  So I've added a quick monkeypatch.

ActiveForm provides a DSL for defining complete XHTML forms with validation.
You can compose your own widgets and (nested) form sections from basic elements.
Markup is generated by Builder, using several wrappers and callbacks which render
their child elements accordingly. This allows one to customize all output.

Both serverside as well as clientside validation is supported and values are bound
in a nested fashion to their elements, similar to how Rails expects params from forms.

It's possible to output elements, sections and the complete forms, allowing easy
integration with ERB templates. While it's distributed as a gem it can easily
be used as a plugin for Rails.

See test/ and samples/ for more information.
